# AdBlock Plus Plus

AdBlock Plus Plus claims to be an ad-blocker that runs on a server to save client-side processing power, but secretly censors data at the deployer's disposal.

This is a collaborative project with [lucasliebe](https://github.com/lucasliebe) and [tiny-fish-T](https://github.com/tiny-fish-T) and is being developed within the scope of a course named *DarkAI* at [HPI](https://hpi.de). The course's goal is to raise awareness about possible adverse effects of AI and provoke more critical thinking in handling software products.
